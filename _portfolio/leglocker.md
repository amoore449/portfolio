Leg Locker is a project originally conceptualized by our classmate and paralympic swimmer, <a href="https://tuftsdaily.com/sports/2018/11/14/gelfand-finds-community-self-confidence-paralympic-swimming/">David Gelfald</a> and our classmate<a href="jeffreyblitt.com"> Jeffrey Blitt </a>
David wears a lower limb prosthetic on his left leg and noticed that there is a lot of unused space within the leg. Being able to store food, liquid, or small objects within that space would add extra utlity to an already useful device for David. He suggested turning this concept into our final project for senior design.
