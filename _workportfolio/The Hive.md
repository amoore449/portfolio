My current workplace! The Hive is a public-access, completely free makerspace located at the Cambridge Public Library. In my current roll, I provide trainings and classes on 3D printing, laser cutting, vinyl cutting, sewing, and general design and fabrication. Provide technical support to patrons and prepare and deliver educational programs to patrons.
