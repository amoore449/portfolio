A painting inspired by one of my favorite poems, Ukrainian-American poet Ilya Kaminsky's "We Lived Happily During the War." 
I originally came across Kaminsky's work while working a summer job for the former publisher of a 1990 teen literary magazine called
"Writes of Passage." Over twenty years later, the publisher had been interested in coordinating a reunion issue and asked me to see what the young people who were published in the magazine had done in their adults lives and to attempt to get in contact with them. Kaminsky had been published in
the magazine as a teenager and was the only person I found who went on to be a professional poet.

**We Lived Happily During the War - Ilya Kaminsky**


*And when they bombed other peopleâ€™s houses, we*
 
*protested*
*but not enough, we opposed them but not*
 
*enough. I was*
*in my bed, around my bed America*
 
*was falling: invisible house by invisible house by invisible house.*
 
*I took a chair outside and watched the sun.*
 
*In the sixth month*
*of a disastrous reign in the house of money*
 
*in the street of money in the city of money in the country of money,*

*our great country of money, we (forgive us)*
 
*lived happily during the war.*
